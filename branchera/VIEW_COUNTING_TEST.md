# View Counting Implementation Test

## Features Implemented

### 1. Discussion View Counting
- ✅ Added `views` and `viewedBy` fields to discussion data model
- ✅ Implemented `incrementDiscussionView()` function in useDatabase hook
- ✅ View count increments only when discussion is **expanded** (not collapsed)
- ✅ Each user can only increment the view count once per discussion
- ✅ View count is displayed in the discussion header with an eye icon

### 2. Reply View Counting
- ✅ Added `views` and `viewedBy` fields to reply data model
- ✅ Implemented `incrementReplyView()` function in useDatabase hook
- ✅ View count increments only when reply is **expanded** (not collapsed)
- ✅ Each user can only increment the view count once per reply
- ✅ View count is displayed in each reply with an eye icon

### 3. User Experience
- ✅ View counting only happens for authenticated users
- ✅ View counts are persistent in the database
- ✅ Real-time UI updates when views are incremented
- ✅ No error messages shown to users if view counting fails
- ✅ View counts are displayed with appropriate eye icons

## How It Works

### Discussion Views
1. When a user clicks to expand a discussion card, `toggleDiscussion()` is called
2. If the discussion was previously collapsed and user is authenticated:
   - `incrementDiscussionView()` is called with discussionId and userId
   - Database checks if user has already viewed this discussion
   - If not, increments view count and adds user to viewedBy array
   - Local state is updated to reflect the new view count

### Reply Views
1. When a user clicks to expand reply children, `toggleReply()` is called
2. If the reply was previously collapsed and user is authenticated:
   - `onReplyView()` callback is triggered
   - `incrementReplyView()` is called with discussionId, replyId, and userId
   - Database updates the specific reply's view count
   - Local state is updated to reflect the new view count

## Database Schema Changes

### Discussion Document
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  views: 0,           // Total view count
  viewedBy: []        // Array of user IDs who have viewed this discussion
}
```

### Reply Object (within discussion.replies array)
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  views: 0,           // Total view count
  viewedBy: []        // Array of user IDs who have viewed this reply
}
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Sign in** with a user account
3. **Create a discussion** or use an existing one
4. **Verify discussion view counting**:
   - Note the initial view count (should be 0 for new discussions)
   - Click to expand the discussion
   - View count should increment by 1
   - Collapse and re-expand - view count should NOT increment again
5. **Add replies** to the discussion
6. **Verify reply view counting**:
   - Expand the replies section
   - For replies with children, click to expand them
   - View count should increment by 1 for each reply expansion
   - Re-expanding should NOT increment the count again
7. **Test with different users** to verify multiple users can view and increment counts
8. **Refresh the page** to verify view counts persist

## Files Modified

1. **`/hooks/useDatabase.js`**:
   - Added view tracking fields to discussion and reply data models
   - Added `incrementDiscussionView()` function
   - Added `incrementReplyView()` function

2. **`/components/DiscussionFeed.js`**:
   - Updated to use new view counting functions
   - Modified `toggleDiscussion()` to increment views on expansion
   - Added view count display in discussion header
   - Added `onReplyView` handler for ReplyTree component

3. **`/components/ReplyTree.js`**:
   - Added `onReplyView` prop
   - Modified `toggleReply()` to increment views on expansion
   - Added view count display for each reply

## Error Handling

- View counting failures are logged to console but don't interrupt user experience
- If database operations fail, the UI continues to work normally
- Users without authentication cannot increment view counts
- Duplicate views from same user are prevented at the database level

## Performance Considerations

- View counts are only incremented on user interaction (expansion)
- Database writes are minimal (only when a new view occurs)
- Local state updates provide immediate UI feedback
- View tracking arrays (`viewedBy`) are kept minimal by storing only user IDs
